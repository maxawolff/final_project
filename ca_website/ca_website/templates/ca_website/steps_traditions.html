    <h2 class=cleartop>12 Traditions of Cocaine Anonymous</h2>
    <ol class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">1. Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon C.A. unity.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">2. For our group purpose, there is but one ultimate authority—a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">3. The only requirement for C.A. membership is a desire to stop using cocaine and all other mind-altering substances.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">4. Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or C.A. as a whole.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">5. Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry its message to the addict who still suffers.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">6. A C.A. group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the C.A. name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">7. Every C.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">8. Cocaine Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but our service centers may employ special workers.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">9. C.A., as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">10. Cocaine Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the C.A. name ought never be drawn into public controversy.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">11. Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, television and films.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">12. Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.</li>
