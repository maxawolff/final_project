        <p>Welcome to Cocaine Anonymous. We are all here for the same reasonâ€”our inability to stop using cocaine and all other mind-altering substances. The first step towards solving any problem is admitting that there is a problem.</p>
        <p>The problem, as we see it, consists of an obsession of the mind and an allergy of the body. The obsession is a continued and irresistible thought of the drugs and the next high. The allergy creates an absolute inability to stop using once we begin.</p>
        <p>We wish to assure you that there is a solution and that recovery is possible. It begins with abstinence and continues with practicing the Twelve Steps of recovery, one day at a time. Our program, the Twelve Steps of Cocaine Anonymous, is the means by which we move from the problem of addiction to the solution of recovery.</p>
